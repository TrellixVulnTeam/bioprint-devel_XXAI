BioPrint started off as a fork of [bioprint](https://github.com/foosel/bioprint) by
[Gina Häußge](https://github.com/foosel). Parts of its communication layer, 
server side GCODE interpreter, and printer management are still based on bioprint's
code base from October 2015 and hence on the work of its authors up until then.
