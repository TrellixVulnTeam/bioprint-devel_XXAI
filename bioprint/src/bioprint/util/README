The code in this sub package mostly originates from the Cura project (https://github.com/daid/Cura). It has been
slightly reorganized and adapted. The mapping to the original Cura source is the following:

* avr_isp.* => Cura.avr_isp.*
* comm => Cura.util.machineCom (highly modified now)
* gcodeInterpreter => Cura.util.gcodeInterpreter

Some code also originates from the [tendo](https://github.com/pycontribs/tendo/blob/master/tendo/singleton.py) project

* singleton => tendo.singleton
